Starting in these programs I want you to output your name and the lab number and name on the console (output). Don't stop putting your name in the documentation... ADD this at the top of the output.

                          Your name           Lab 3  age2030

Enter your current age: 25
Enter the current year : 2014 

You will be 41 in 2030

The bold text is the user input.

 

Create a program for each of the following (Submit the .cpp source code file for each):
