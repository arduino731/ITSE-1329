Some of the teams might lose a member so the slack must be taken up by the surviving members. If the survivors complain that someone did not work, their grade will be docked accordingly.

In the comments in the program add the following lines of code

// program name: xxxxxxxxx
// Group x  - put all names in group here (put your group name in ;)
// programer: name of coder for this program
 

Remember if the program is not done then the survivors will also be docked.

1. (add) Create a program that will output the sum of all the odd 
numbers between 1 and 99 inclusive. 

2. (cash) Allow the user to key in any number of item prices for items 
purchased in a discount store. Display the grand total amount of all 
items including an addition of 8% tax on all items. 

3. (bunny) Allow the user to input any number of rabbit weights in 
pounds into the program. Output the average of all rabbit weights, the 
largest rabbit weight, and the total number of rabbits.

NOTE: The group leader should state who was the team leader and the names of the others in the group using the assignment comments when they submit the assignment.
